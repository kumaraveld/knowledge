Symmetric Encryption:

Same key is used for Encryption and Decryption
Both server and client should have same key for encryption
Vulnerable to attack
Examples: Blowfish, AES, RC4, DES, RC5, and RC6
Asymmetric encryption:

Server generates its own public and private key
Client generates its own public and private key
Server and client exchanges their public keys
Server uses client’s public key to encrypt data
Client uses server ‘s public key to encrypt data
Server uses its private key to decrypt data sent by client
Client uses its private key to decrypt data sent by server
example: EIGamal, RSA, DSA, Elliptic curve techniques, PKCS.
